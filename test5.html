        <p>Wipro Consultancy Services has a comprehensive recruitment process for both freshers and experienced candidates. Here are the details:</p>
        <h3>For Freshers:</h3>
        <p>To apply for TCS, you need to meet their academic criteria, typically requiring a minimum of 60% marks in Class 10, Class 12, and minimum 6 CGPA in pursing degree graduation. The recruitment process consists of three rounds:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Online assessment round</li>
            <li>Technical Interview</li>
            <li>HR Interview</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Online assessment round</h3>
        
        </ol>
        <p>Interview round 1:  

            The online assessment test is the first step in the recruitment process:
            Aptitude: The Aptitude Test is the initial step in the Wipro hiring process. This round is broken down into three sections:
            Quantitative Aptitude: The candidate's mathematical abilities will be tested in this phase. Time, Speed & Distance, Number Series, Simple & Compound Interest, Probability, Permutation & Combination, Ratios & Proportions, and Percentages are all covered in the Quantitative Aptitude section.
            Logical Reasoning: The portion will assess the candidate's ability to think critically and logically. In this part, you will be asked questions about the following topics: Coding, Decoding, Series, Analogy and Visual Reasoning, Data Sufficiency, Data Interpretation, ​Data Arrangements, Logical Word Sequence, ​Statements and Inferences, ​Inequalities.
            Verbal Ability: This section will assess the candidates' English abilities. The following subjects will be the focus of the questions in this section:  Error-Spotting, Sentence Improvement, Sentence Completion, and Para-Jumbles among others.
            Coding: Candidates can take the coding assessment in any of the following programming languages: Java, C, C++, or Python. Fundamentals of Programming must be mastered in at least one programming language of his/her choice. Generally, two or three coding questions are asked in this round. The following are the topics that must be mastered: Decision Making, Looping, Functions,  Arrays, and Strings.
        </p>            
        <h3>Technical Interview:</h3>
        <p>
            Candidates who pass the online assessment round will be called to face-to-face technical interviews.
Your technical abilities are evaluated during a technical interview, which is usually related to the technical knowledge required for the position that you have applied for. The questions will put your problem-solving and numerical reasoning skills to the test. Interviewers are interested in how candidates approach problems, construct their thought process, and display personal qualities such as communication, in addition to technical knowledge (which is vital).
The technical face-to-face interview is the most crucial step in the process. You should be familiar with computer fundamentals such as OOPS, DBMS, CN,  OS, etc, and be able to explain them to the interviewer. It is necessary to be familiar with a programming language. Make sure you know at least one programming language. You do not need to be fluent in all programming languages, but at least one, such as C++, Java, or Python, should be familiar to you. You can be asked to write code too. Your problem-solving skills will also be evaluated by the interviewer. You'll be asked about your previous projects and professional experiences, including what you did, how you employed technology, and how successful you were.
The number of technical interviews to be conducted will be based on your performances in previous rounds, job profile, and company requirements.

            </p>
            
        <h3>HR Interview:</h3>
        <p>
            Every organization conducts an HR interview round to assess your personality, strengths, shortcomings, and ability to handle the task, as well as to assess your background and determine if you're the ideal fit for this position. The HR round will be held for candidates who have cleared the technical interview.  They can also ask questions about Wipro’s history, including when it was created, its goals, principles, and organizational structure.

            <b> 1.What are the differences between an object-oriented programming language and object-based programming language?
                </b>
                <p>Object-oriented languages adhere to all Object Oriented Programming concepts, but object-based languages do not adhere to all Object Oriented Programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
                Object-oriented languages lack built-in objects, but object-based languages do. For example, JavaScript contains a built-in window object.

            <b>2. What do you understand about order of precedence and associativity in Java, and how do you use them?
            </b><br>
            The operators are arranged in order of precedence. When a number of operators are employed in an expression, the priorities of the operators determine how the expression is evaluated. In an expression containing multiple operators with various precedences, operator precedence decides which one is executed first.
            <br>
            <b>3. What are the differences between error and exception in Java?

            </b> <br>
            An error occurs when a user performs an unauthorised action that causes the code to behave abnormally. Errors in programming are frequently unnoticed until the code is compiled or run. Some of the errors make it impossible to compile or run a program. As a result, errors should be removed before compiling and running a program. Out of memory and system crash are two examples of errors.
            In Java, an exception is an unwelcome or unexpected occurrence that occurs during the program execution, or during run time, and disturbs the usual flow of the program's instructions. Exceptions are circumstances that arise during the program execution and may result in its termination. However, try, catch, and throw keywords can be used to recover them.
            Unchecked exceptions (exceptions which are not checked at compile time), such as ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException, are known to the compiler at runtime, whereas checked exceptions (exceptions which are checked at compile time), such as IOException, are known to the compiler at compile time.

            <b>4.  Explain precondition and postcondition to a member function in the context of C++ programming language.?
                </b> <br>
                A precondition is a condition that must be met before a member function may be called. If preconditions are never false, a class is appropriately used. If a precondition fails to hold, the following function is not executed.
                A post-condition is a condition that must be true when a member function is exited if the precondition was true when the function was entered.
            <br>
           <b>  5.Explain free() vs delete () in C++?
        </b><br>
        The free() function is a C library function that can also be used in C++, whereas the keyword "delete" is a C++ keyword.
        The delete operator deletes a pointer that was allocated using the new operator or a NULL pointer, whereas the free() function deletes a pointer that was allocated with the malloc(), calloc(), or realloc() functions or a NULL pointer.

            <br>
           <b> 6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of indexing in DBMS?
</b> <br>
Indexing is a technique for improving the database performance by reducing the number of disc accesses needed when a query is run. It's a data structure strategy for finding and accessing data in a database rapidly.
            <br>
           <b> 7.What are the benefits of Hybrid Clouds in Cloud Computing?

        </b> <br>
        A hybrid cloud is computing, storage, and service environment that combines on-premises infrastructure, private cloud services, and a public cloud (such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure) with orchestration among the platforms. Hybrid cloud infrastructure is one that combines public clouds, on-premises computing, and private clouds in your cloud server.
