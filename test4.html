        <p>Interview round 1:  TCS NQT

            The first round of the TCS recruitment process is TCS NQT (National Qualifier Test), which is considered one of the most difficult stages of the procedure. It is an Ability Test that evaluates a candidate's abilities and skills. TCS NQT Exams are offered both online (at home) and in-person at TCS iON Authorised Exam Centers.Numerical ability: Number Systems, Arithmetic, Elementary Statistics, and Data Interpretation are all assessed in this part.

            Hands-on exercise of coding.
            
</p>            
        <h3>Technical Interview:</h3>
        <p>This is the most challenging stage of the hiring process, so do your best to prepare for it. The focus of the entire interview process will be on your technical knowledge, biography, and primary projects.

            The technical round of the TCS interview which is face to face consists of questions designed to assess the candidate's knowledge of data structures and algorithms, database management systems, operating systems, networking, object-oriented programming ideas, and a programming language of your choice. There's a considerable chance you'll be asked to write some code on pen and paper.
            
            </p>
            <h3>Managerial round</h3>
            <p>The managerial round is handled by a panel of senior members. This is also a face-to-face interview round. This round may consist entirely of technical questions or a combination of technical and managerial questions. The majority of the questions are based on the profile for which you are being interviewed. You should be up to date on any new technologies or software required for that position. You may also be asked questions based on your actions to assess your thinking style. You could be put under pressure to see how you react. Your CV's achievements may be questioned, and you may have to defend them. You may be questioned about your previous working experiences, your objectives, motivations for joining TCS, and other similar topics.

                The panel will assess your corporate culture fit, attitude, soft skills, desired career advancement, and other factors in this round.
                You might also be asked generic questions about your work experience, college degree, speciality, desire to relocate, and so on. In any event, regardless of the route the interview takes, always be gracious. The interview panel aims to force you to step outside of your comfort zone. Maintain your composure and respond to the questions that you are familiar with. If the answer is unknown, don't give up; instead, try it with what you know</p>
        <h3>HR Interview:</h3>
        <p>Expect questions about work experience, education, interests, and family background, in addition to the standard HR questions about strengths and weaknesses, reasons for applying to the company, why you should be hired, and so on. They can also ask questions about TCS - when it was formed, its objectives, values, organizational structure, and so on.
           Most candidates believe that the HR interview is simple, but keep in mind that a poor HR interview can jeopardize your chances of receiving the job, even if you have cleared all other hurdles (aptitude test, technical round, etc.). The goal is to maintain a pleasant and confident demeanour. Interviews can be long and tedious, so remember to smile!
           This is the last stage of the hiring process. Candidates are expected to be adaptable, yet this phase allows for negotiation. The most common questions asked are :
           Please tell me about yourself. (Start with your academics, projects, achievements, other curriculum activities, and your strengths if you are a beginner. Also, tell them about your hobbies, background, and so on. If you're an experienced professional, start with your present position, achievements, previous work history, and then academic and personal information.)
           Why do you want to work in the IT field?
           Why are you interested in working for TCS?
           Are you willing to relocate to different parts of India?
           Why are you looking for a job change? (If you're an experienced professional seeking a change, this is a common question. The easiest method to respond to this question is to state that you are leaving your current work in order to advance your career. Make sure you don't criticize or speak poorly about the company where you now work.)
           What is your expected salary? (This is a difficult question to answer. It is generally asked of experienced employees. You may inquire about the company's standard raise for employees.</p>

            <b> 1. What is Socket Programming? What Are The Benefits And Drawbacks Of Java Sockets?
                </b>
                Socket programming is a method of allowing two network nodes to communicate with each other. One socket (node) listens on a specific port at an IP address, while the other socket connects with it. While the client connects to the server, the server creates the listener socket.
                Java Socket Benefits:Sockets are adaptable and adequate. For general communications, efficient socket-based programming is simple to build.
                Java Socket Drawbacks:Because a Java applet running in a Web browser can only connect to the machine from which it originated and nowhere else on the network, security restrictions can be oppressive at times.

            <b>2. What is IPsec? What are its components?
            </b><br>
            IP security (IPSec) is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard suite of protocols that offer data authentication, integrity, and confidentiality between two communication points over in ip network.
            consists of the following components:
            1.Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP): Data integrity, encryption, authentication, and anti-replay are all provided by ESP. It also supports payload authentication.
            2.Authentication Header (AH): This header also supports data integrity, authentication, and anti-replay, but not encryption. anti-replay protection guards against unwanted packet transmission. It does not ensure the privacy of data.
            
            <br>
            <b>3. What is NAT?
            </b> <br>
            Network Address Translation (NAT) is an acronym for Network Address Translation. It involves modifying the IP headers of packets being transported over a traffic routing device to remap one IP address space to another.

        </b>
            <b>4. What is the difference between a clustered index and non clustered index ?
                </b> <br>
                clustered index is a form of index that reorders the physical storage of records in a table, whereas a non clustered index is one in which the logical order of the index does not match the physical storage order of the rows on the disc. Insert and update operations are faster than with a clustered index. Data is physically stored in index order, making it faster to read than non-clustered data.
            <br>
           <b>  What is a Ping?
        </b><br>
        A ping is a computer program that is used to determine whether a host is reachable and capable of accepting requests across an IP network. It operates by sending an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Echo to a network computer and waiting for a response. It can be used for troubleshooting as well.

            <br>
           <b> 6. Discuss the RSA algorithm in brief.</b> <br>
           The RSA, an asymmetric cryptography algorithm, is used to protect the data transfer. For encryption, this technique uses a public key, while the decryption key is kept secure or secret. Two huge prime numbers are used to generate the encryption key, which is then publicized along with an auxiliary value. This public key can be used for encryption by anyone, but only someone who knows the prime numbers can decrypt it. This technique, however, is believed to be slow, and as a result, it is not frequently used to encryt data.
            <br>
           <b> 7. In a software program, what is cyclomatic complexity?
        </b> <br>
        The number of linearly independent paths in a code segment is measured in terms of cyclomatic complexity. It's a software statistic that shows how complex a code is. It is calculated using the program's Control Flow Graph. The nodes in the graph represent the smallest set of commands in a program, and a directed edge connects the two nodes, indicating whether the second command should be executed immediately after the first.
       The directed graph inside control flow is the edge connecting two basic blocks of the program mathematically, as control may flow from first to second.
       CC = E − N + P
