        <h2>Recruitment Process</h2>
        <p>Microsoft has a comprehensive recruitment process for both freshers and experienced candidates. Here are the details:</p>
        <h3>For Freshers:</h3>
        <p>To apply for Microsoft, you need to meet their academic criteria, typically requiring a minimum of 70% marks in Class 10, Class 12, and minimum 6 CGPA in pursing degree graduation. The recruitment process consists of three rounds:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Written and Online Assessment Test</li>
            <li>Technical Interview</li>
            <li>HR Interview</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Online Assessment Test:</h3>
        
        </ol>
        <p>The online assessment test holds three sections with time limits and cutoffs set for each. Three sections in the online assessment test include:

            The CoCube or the online coding round consists of 5 to six competitive coding questions with a time limit running between 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes. The questions level varies consisting of questions from domains of Arrays, String, Single Linked List, Double Linked List etc.
            The group fly round or the onsite round consists of a written coding contest. Questions are provided and time span of 10 to 15 minutes are given to solve it and another 20 minutes are provided to explain the approach to the mentor, under whose supervision one is assigned to do the task. One should be well versed with the domains of competitive coding, data structure and algorithms to clear the round.
        
        <h3>Technical Interview:</h3>
        <p>These consist of face to face rounds with the interviewer and to pass through these round one should have good knowledge regarding the facts mentioned in the CV. The questions are generally asked from the projects, internships or training mentioned in the CV. Following this one should be well known with the course related subjects like Data Structure, Algorithms, Operating System, Networking, Database Management etc. So, basically, the interview tests whether everything mentioned in the CV is full proof and the interviewee is having in-depth knowledge regarding the subjects dealt during the course of engineering. Students can also be expected to write codes in the interview. The final technical round consists of System Designing where questions from various domains can be asked like Cloud COmputing, Microsoft Azure, Dropbox and various Microsoft technology driven engines.</p>
        <h3>HR Interview:</h3>
        <p>This round deals less with the technical questions but more with the HR questions like:

            Where do you see yourself in next 5 years, 15 years and 25 years?
            Questions on family background.
            Strengths and Weaknesses.
            Questions on the facts mentioned in the CV.</p>

    <section id="salary">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <p>Microsoft likes to ask mostly Array/Strings/LinkedList problems so the candidate is advised to especially prepare these topics. Arriving at the most optimized solution is key here. The design rounds test the candidate's ability to design complex systems like Gmail, YouTube, Uber </p>
        <p>
            <b>1. Tell me about yourself?</b> <br>

            <br>
            <b>2.  How can I prepare for Microsoft Interview?
            </b><br>
            Make your resume one page long and must contain information that is important. Because recruiters only have 15 seconds to scan a CV, keep it short and accurate. Only write down what you are comfortable with; do not makeup anything during the interview because the interviewer will be able to tell if you are faking it. If you're going to talk about your project, you should also talk about its intricacy. Examine it.
If you will be graduating from a university, Microsoft offers a particular website dedicated to student recruitment
Microsoft occasionally recruits at job fairs, hackathons, and other events, but waiting for any of these opportunities to occur organically can be a long process, depending on where you are in the world. You can check out hackathon.com to see if there are any upcoming hackathons.
Maintain your LinkedIn, Github, and other profiles; recruiting managers utilise tools like LinkedIn, alumni databases, and professional associations to locate qualified candidates.

            <b>3. What should I expect at a Microsoft interview?
            </b> <br>
The first round of Microsoft: You'll move on to the next step of the process if things with the recruiter go smoothly. Depending on the team and role you're applying for, what occurs next is different. However, if you're an industry hire, you can normally expect a phone interview, an on-campus interview if you're a recent graduate, and in some situations, an online test instead of an actual interview. They're going to go over everything.
Phones featuring Technical screens: This is known as the 'phone screen', but it can also occur via video using Skype. The duration of each interview will be 45 to 60 minutes. You'll be interviewed by a colleague or a future manager, who will ask you a mix of technical and behavioural questions.
You should expect standard data structure and algorithm questions in the technical portion of the interview, which you'll have to answer in an online collaborative text editor. You'll need to get used to not having syntax highlighting or autocomplete in the text editor during your interview preparation. It's also worth noting that you're unlikely to be asked to design a system.
You can expect questions like this in the behavioural section 'Tell me about yourself', 'Why Microsoft?' or 'What Microsoft product is your favourite?' And why is that? 'Microsoft interviewers, in our experience, spend more time on behavioural questions than their Facebook or Google counterparts. As a result, it's important to make sure you're prepared for common behavioural queries (more on that later).
Interview on-campus: If you're a student, you'll almost always be interviewed in person rather than over the phone. You'll be offered a mixture of behavioural and technical questions to answer on a whiteboard. You may have many interviews on campus in some circumstances.
Online coding assessment: Before advancing a candidate to the onsite interviews, Microsoft may also use online coding assessments. The company uses a number of tests, but the most popular is a three-question examination offered by Codility that you must complete in 60 to 90 minutes. You must submit a solution to the problems, which are typical data structure and algorithm questions.
Onsite Interview: If you qualify for the first stage, you'll spend a full day at one of Microsoft's offices, taking part in four on-site interviews. These one-on-one interviews will last approximately 60 minutes and will include a mix of people from the team you're applying to join, including colleagues, the hiring manager, and occasionally a senior executive.
Types of questions: Three or four of your interviews will involve code problems (data structure and algorithm questions) that you must answer on a whiteboard. The last one or two interviews will focus on system design issues. All of your interviews will include behavioural questions.
Coding and behavioural questions are likely to be exceedingly difficult for all candidates. You might not be asked system design questions if you're a junior (SDE II or lower). And if you do, the bar will be lower than for senior or mid-level engineers (e.g. Senior SDE or above).
The 'as appropriate', AA or ASAPP interview: Finally, you'll have one last interview with a Microsoft executive (e.g. your hiring manager or possibly their boss). 
<br>
            <b>4. Is Infosys Interview easy?</b> <br>
            The difficulty level of Infosys interview is moderate. If you have good technical and communication skills, then you can easily crack all the rounds without any difficulties. If you prepare properly for the Infosys interview, you can answer any difficult questions from the interviewer.
            <br>
           <b> 5.How long is the Microsoft Interview Process? </b><br>
           The complete interview process for a software engineer post at Microsoft takes about 1-2 months on average.
            <br>
           <b> 6. How do I apply for a job at Microsoft?</b> <br>
           The business encourages looking for jobs on the Microsoft Careers page. This website allows you to create a profile, apply for open positions, set up job notifications, and track the progress of your application.
If you see several desirable positions, feel free to apply to all of them.
If you want to take part in the employee referral programme, contact your corporate contact and have them submit your information.
            <br>
           <b> 7.Why do you want to join Microsoft?
        </b> <br>
        The first reason is that this is where I see myself in the long run. I want to have a great career with an organisation that will allow me to learn, grow, and develop. Microsoft has an incredible history of invention and ongoing achievement, and I want to have a successful career with an organisation that will allow me to learn, grow, and develop.
The second reason is that Microsoft is a place where I can be myself - I am an honest person with a wide range of talents and abilities, but I am also aware that I have much more to learn. As the phrase goes, 'knowledge can be learned, but trust must be won', and I believe that by hard work and an honest approach to duties, I will be able to win the trust of my coworkers and bosses.
