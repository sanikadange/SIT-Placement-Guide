            <b>6. Why is it suggested to utilise a database management system (DBMS)? List some of its primary advantages to explain.?</b> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Minimizing Data Redundancy: DBMS supports a system to eliminate data redundancy within the database by integrating all data into a single database, and because data is stored in only one location, there is no duplication of data.</li>
                <li>Data Sharing: In a DBMS, data can be shared among several users at the same time because the same database is shared across all users and by various applications.</li>
                <li>Data Integrity:This refers to the database's data being consistent and accurate at all times. It is critical because a database management system (DBMS) contains numerous databases, each of which contains data that is visible to multiple users. As a result, it's critical to guarantee that data is accurate and consistent across all databases and for all users.</li>
                <li>Data Security:Only approved users should be allowed access to the database, and their identities should be authenticated using a legitimate login and password. Under no circumstances should unauthorized users be allowed to access the database, as this would break the integrity limitations.</li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <b>7. Why is normalization needed in a database? </b><br>
            The term "normalization" refers to the process of analyzing relation schemas based on their functional dependencies. Normalization is the technique of splitting up data into numerous tables to reduce redundancy.

            The advantages of normalization are:
            <ul>
               <li>Standardization eliminates the copy information, allowing a smaller database to be maintained. As a result, the size of the database is reduced in general.</li>
            <li>Better execution is assured, which is related to the previous point. As the size of information bases shrinks, the time it takes to process it becomes shorter and more constrained, enhancing reaction time and speed.</li>
            <li>Narrower tables may be possible as standardized tables are altered and feature fewer segments, allowing for more data items per page.</li>
           <li> With fewer files per table, support assignments are completed faster (file modifies)</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <b>8. Distinguish between UNION and UNION ALL</b> <br>
            To aggregate the results of two or more SQL SELECT queries, we use the SQL UNION method. In the union operation, the number of data types and columns in both tables on which the UNION action is performed must be the same. Duplicate rows are removed from the result set by the UNION operation. Union ALL operation is the same as a Union operation. It returns the set without sorting the data or deleting duplicates.
            <br>
            <b>9. What is the difference between Dataset.clone() and Dataset.copy()?</b> <br>
            DataSet. Clone() copies only the DataSet object's schema and returns a DataSet object with the same structure as the existing dataset object, including all the relations, constraints, and schemas. The data from the old one will not be copied to the new one.
            <br>ability can be usually defined as the ability to obtain generic knowledge from specific experiences and apply them to new situations. Infosys also significantly focuses on professional competence and academic excellence. Some of the attributes and competencies that Infosys look for in potential candidates, especially at the entry-level, are analytical ability, communication skills, teamwork, leadership skills, and the ability to innovate.</p>
